This repository was created to track changes to my script.

An actual README for the folder that the script sorts is generated by the script.

Note: I couldn't open the .xdr files. The original README2 mentions that the .xdr files are "structures that you get back."  Online descriptions of .xdr files makes it sound like
they can be used to structure/format data.  As such, I placed the .xdr files in folders intended for programs.
